Overview
Selenium is a Firefox plugin that can open webpages and verify that certain text is present. To run QA's set of Selenium tests, you'll need to:

Download the Selenium Firefox plugin, and
Download QA's set of test cases and open in Selenium
Step 1: Download Selenium
Go to http://seleniumhq.org/download/ and download the latest version of Selenium IDE.
Install the Selenium IDE plugin in Firefox.
Once it's installed,

Step 2: Download Test Cases and Open in Selenium
NOTE: There are now two ways to run the Selenium Tests: QA Server or locally. Running Selenium from the "QA Server" means that the iterantion number is globally changed for all testers that need to run Selenium tests against the production environment. Running Selenium "locally" means each tester is responsible to ensure that his/her iteration number is current per iteration prior to use.

Locally (C: drive)

Download Selenium tests from Sidecar Repo.
Unzip the file to c:\selenium (Note: Tests will not work if you do not.)
In Firefox, go to Tools > Selenium IDE
Once Selenium opens, go to File > Open Test Suite...
Navigate to c:\selenium and select the test set you want to run
Click Open

If you opened the test suite successfully, you will see a list of tests cases in Selenium IDE that are ready to be run.
